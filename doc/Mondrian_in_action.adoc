== Beyond reporting: bussiness analitycs


=== The need for bussines analytics.
* OLAP: Online analytical processing is a technology that makes business
data available with enough structure for business users to easily explore data and discover important data relationships without having to understand database query languages or the organization of a company’s operational databases.
* Mondrian is an open source OLAP engine that provides access to data in a way
that’s intuitive to users. As an engine, Mondrian can be run in a web container, such as
Tomcat or JBoss, or be embedded as part of an application. Mondrian only requires
an optional configuration, a schema defining the logical structure of the data, and a
database populated with data. Mondrian works with most databases that support Java
database connections.

=== Replacing static reports with online analytical processing(OLAP).
=== OLAP to the rescue.








==== Mondrian let users drive analytics.

*   Mondrian supports user-driven analysis. Users are able to do their own analysis
without a lot of help from administrators or report writers.

==== Mondrian is low cost, low risk solution.
*   Mondrian is a low-cost, low-risk choice. Mondrian is open source and can be
downloaded for free. Mondrian also comes bundled with a number of analysis
tools and suites that make it easy to install and start using.

.  A business user decides to query some data using a number of different front
ends, typically a thin-client interface, such as Pentaho Analyzer.

. The interface creates a Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) query using
either a web service call or a direct API call. MDX is a standardized general
query language used for analysis and supported by most analytics engines. The
advantage of MDX is that it simplifies the calls to the database while also being
extremely powerful. It’s also a common dialect that can be used no matter what
database the data is stored in. Some user interfaces will allow users to directly
enter or modify queries in MDX, allowing users who are comfortable with MDX
syntax to perform more complex queries and use the many functions available
in MDX.

. Mondrian uses a logical schema, organized into cubes of dimensions (attributes
about the data, such as date and location) and measures (the actual data facts,
such as cost, inventory level, and the like). The schema also provides features
for performance optimization and security. Mondrian uses this schema to
retrieve the data either from an in-memory cache or by generating optimized
database calls. Mondrian automatically creates correct SQL for a wide number
of databases.

. Mondrian generates SQL queries based on the metadata description and makes
a database request.

. The database returns a result set of data to Mondrian.

. Mondrian returns the data to the user interface, using a standard API that is understood by the visualization tool.

. Finally, the data is formatted graphically for the user in a tabular format that’s easy to understand and manipulate.

==== Mondrian is fast.
*   Mondrian is fast. It has a variety of optimization techniques that allow users to
perform analysis at the speed of thought using interactive tools.

** Agregates.
** Caching.

==== Mondrian is secure.
*   Mondrian has built-in security capabilities, making it ideal for organizations
with sensitive data.


==== Mondrian is based on open standarts.


*   Mondrian is based on open standards. It runs on a large variety of application
servers and works with most major databases. This means Mondrian won’t lock
you into a proprietary solution.

* In particular, Mondrian supports the following standards:

**   olap4j: An open standard for OLAP via Java

**   XMLA: A standard for system-to-system interaction based on SOAP

**   XML: A standard markup language that lets you create Mondrian schemas with a simple text editor
